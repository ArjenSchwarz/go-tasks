# Decision Log - Batch Operations Simplification and Enhancement

## Initial Decisions

### Decision 1: Unify update and update_status operations
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Analysis revealed that the separation between `update` and `update_status` operations creates unnecessary complexity without providing meaningful benefits.
**Decision:** Merge both operations into a single `update` operation
**Rationale:** 
- Both operations perform essentially the same validation
- Users need two operations to update both status and other fields
- Auto-completion logic can be triggered based on field presence rather than operation type
- Reduces API surface area and cognitive load

### Decision 2: Maintain backward compatibility
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Existing scripts and integrations may rely on `update_status` operation
**Decision:** Keep `update_status` as an alias during deprecation period
**Rationale:** Allows gradual migration without breaking existing workflows

### Decision 3: Parent task auto-completion
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** User requested ability to complete parent tasks and have children auto-complete
**Decision:** Implement recursive auto-completion when parent is marked complete
**Rationale:** Provides intuitive behavior for hierarchical task management

### Decision 4: Position-based task insertion
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** User needs to insert tasks at specific positions without manual renumbering
**Decision:** Add optional `position` field to `add` operation
**Rationale:** Maintains logical ordering and improves task organization workflow

## User Clarifications (2025-09-01)

### Decision 5: Remove parent auto-completion feature
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Initial requirement included auto-completing child tasks when parent is marked complete
**Decision:** Remove this feature from scope
**Rationale:** Simplifies implementation and avoids confusing behavior where marking parent complete would force-complete children

### Decision 6: Position insertion semantics
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Ambiguity about what "insert at position X" means
**Decision:** Insert BEFORE current task at that position (new task takes that number)
**Rationale:** Most intuitive behavior - "insert at position 4" makes the new task become task 4

### Decision 7: Auto-completion trigger behavior
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Whether auto-completion should trigger only for status-only updates or any update with status
**Decision:** Trigger whenever status is set to completed, regardless of other fields
**Rationale:** Consistent and predictable behavior, avoids artificial constraints

### Decision 8: Batch operation reference state
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** How operations in a batch should reference positions when earlier operations change numbering
**Decision:** All operations reference the original pre-batch state
**Rationale:** Simpler mental model, avoids complex interdependencies
**Implementation:** Process position insertions in reverse order to maintain consistency

### Decision 9: Implementation approach
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Whether to implement features separately or together
**Decision:** Implement both remaining features together (unified update and position insertion)
**Rationale:** Both are relatively straightforward with clear specifications

### Decision 10: Empty update handling
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** What to do when update operation has no fields
**Decision:** Treat as no-op without error
**Rationale:** Graceful handling, avoids unnecessary failures

### Decision 11: Remove backward compatibility
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Whether to maintain `update_status` as deprecated alias
**Decision:** Remove `update_status` operation type entirely
**Rationale:** Cleaner implementation without legacy baggage, user prefers clean break

### Decision 12: Remove performance criteria
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Success criteria included performance guarantees
**Decision:** Remove performance requirements from success criteria
**Rationale:** Performance is not a concern for this feature

### Decision 13: Extend position insertion to CLI
**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Context:** Initial requirement only covered batch operations
**Decision:** Add `--position` flag to `go-tasks add` command
**Rationale:** Feature should be available in both CLI and batch API for consistency
